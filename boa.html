                <br></br>
                <h2>Bank of America is the second largest bank in the US after JPMorgan Chase.  Their headquarters are located in  Charlotte, North Carolina.  We chose to design a product for Bank of America to target college students as an academic project for GA’s User Experience Design course.</h2>

                <h2>This was a group project developed by three UX students. The objective was to design a product for Bank of America so the company could help its community by teaching how to budget, instill healthy spending habits, saving money, track student loans and plant a seed for a financial future.</h2>
                
                <h2>My role:  In the project, I was involved in every step of the process and leading the stand ups every day and the Design Studio Sessions. I have shared my process, design decisions, and rationale behind the design approach with my team.</h2>
